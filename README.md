This is a program that tracks flights using Amadeus API, it check the spreadsheet that contains IATA codes and the lowest price from origin (the lowest price was written by myself manualy), after reading spreadsheet, it checks the flights from origin to all cities that are in spreadsheet and write the lowest price it can find to the new column called "get price", and if the lowest price that was found is lower than the lowest price in column spreadsheet, then it will send e-mail automaticly.
